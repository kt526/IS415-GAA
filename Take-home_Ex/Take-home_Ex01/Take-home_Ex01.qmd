# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1. Overview - Setting the Scene

Human mobility, the movement of human beings in space and time, reflects the spatial-temporal characteristics of human behavior. With the advancement Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) especially smart phone, a large volume of data related to human mobility have been collected. By using appropriate GIS analysis methods, these data are potentially useful in supporting smart city planning and management.

In Singapore, one of the important source of data related to human mobility is from [Land Transport Authority (LTA) DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html). Two data sets related to human mobility are provided by the portal, they are: Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Train Stations and Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops. One of the limitation of these data sets is that their location are biased to either bus stops or MRT/LRT stations. In 2020, another very interesting human mobility data set called [Grab Posisi](https://engineering.grab.com/grab-posisi) was released by GRAB, one of the largest shared taxi operator in South-east Asia. There are two data sets been released and one of them is for Singapore.

## 1.2 Objectives

Geospatial analytics hold tremendous potential to address complex problems facing society.

In this study, we will:

-   Apply appropriate spatial point patterns analysis methods

-   Discover the geographical and spatial-temporal distribution of Grab hailing services locations in Singapore

## 1.3 Getting Started

In this hands-on exercise, we will be using the following packages:
